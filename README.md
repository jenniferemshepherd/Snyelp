Snyelp: Ruby on Rails Yelp Challenge
==================

Brief Summary of Approach
-------
We worked as a group this week and set Ground Rules from the off as to how we would work in an Agile environment, exemplifying XP values.  This included daily standups in the morning and retros in the evening, with merge parties as appropriate throughout the day.  We mobbed at the start of the week whilst we were initially learning rails and then split into rotating pairs to implement features.

Points for development:
* CSS for styling
* Users own their reviews and restaurants - and are limited to where they can post as a result.

Instructions
-------

* Clone this repository
* cd snyelp
* Run 'bin/rails s' to get the project running on the server and nagivate to it in your choice of browser (local host:3000 is most likely)
